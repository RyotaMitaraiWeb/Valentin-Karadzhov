        >My first exposure to programming was in a computer science class back
        in 10th grade. In that class, we had to use a self-teaching platform to
        learn programming with C++. I initially had a lot of fun with that and
        became motivated to learn more. However, at some point, I started to
        struggle with some more advanced concepts, especially object-oriented
        programming, thus I decided to move to web development, initially
        starting with learning HTML. Over time, I broadened my skillset with
        more technologies by practicing a lot and developing many personal
        projects. At some point, I was also able to understand the advanced
        concepts that gave me a hard time as a beginner, allowing me to overcome
        the obstacles that tripped me back then

      I am a huge fan of testing and have employed test-driven development
      multiple times in my projects. I also aim for readable code, because code
      is written by humans, for humans. Most importantly, I always strive to
      learn new things; for example, my projects tend to incorporate new
      technologies, techniques, and methodologies which I have never heard of or
      tried prior that momen

        >I graduated high school with specialization in Spanish. During my high
        school years, I was a member of my school's debates club, which gave me
        opportunities to not only do public speeches, but to also defend
        viewpoints and ideas that I did not necessarily agree with. I have also
        made it to second rounds of olympiads dedicated to English, Spanish, and
        philosophy</Text

      I obtained my bachelor's degree in marketing in 2025 at the University of
      National and World Economics. I have used some of the knowledge I obtained
      there in my time as a freelance web designer.
