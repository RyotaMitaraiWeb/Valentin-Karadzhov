/*
	Inline script below is used this way so that the theme can be loaded before
	the CSS has loaded, preventing а flash of unstyled content. Astro, by default,
	uses module scripts, which are asynchronous. Inline scripts do not support
	imports, so WET code is pretty much necessary here.

	Because of this, if you make any changes to the theming, you need to
	check this file as well and ensure it's consistent with the changes.

	The script is also executed as an IIFE to prevent global scope pollution.
