  ><em>"Zlatni Migove"</em> (meaning "Golden Ages" in Bulgarian) is a fictional senior
  club that hosts various intellectually stimulating events like quizzes and board
  games. The concept for the brand was conceived (in collaboration with other students)
  as a course project in the discipline
  <i>Marketing planning</i>
  during my fourth year in university. The concept was developed as an answer to
  the various social and health challenges that the seniors in Bulgaria face throughout
  their retirement years, such as social isolation and degrading mental capacities.
  This fictional club aims to solve these problems by providing an outlet for the
  seniors to engage in mental tasks that keep their minds fresh in a fun and engaging
  way and a community of like-minded seniors that may face the same needs and challenges.
  Thus, the values of the brand include inclusivity, unity, and, rather contradictorily,
  modernity and traditionality.</Text

    that are rounded. Shapes like rectangles feel familiar and calm to the
    seniors, while their round edges and the minimalist design gives them a
    feeling of modernity instead of making the seniors feel "outdated"</Text

  >One of the materials that I developed was the logo of the brand, which I made
  in <i>Illustrator</i>. The logo represents an hour glass rotated 90 degrees to
  resemble the infinity symbol. This symbolizes the eternity of the "golden
  ages" of the retirement years. Its horizontal position further supports this
  notion, as the hour glass does not typically run when in a horizontal
  position. Finally, the sand inside the clock is an irregular shape whose
  curves fit in with the curves of the hour glass, symbolizing that the seniors
  do have a place where they belong.</Text
