  <em>Quiz World</em> is a web application that's all about quizzes. The app provides
  a clean UI for playing and creating quizzes. The quizzes in the app support three
  types of questions:</Text
>
<ul class="pl-4 list-disc">
  <Text selector="li"
    ><b>Single-choice questions</b> - multiple options provided, of which one is
    correct</Text
  >
  <Text selector="li"
    ><b>Multiple-choice questions</b> - multiple options provided, of which <em
      >at least one</em
    > is correct. Players must pick all correct options</Text
  >
  <Text selector="li"
    ><b>Text questions</b> - the player must input the correct answer in the provided
    text field</Text
  >
</ul>

<Text>In addition to creating and playing quizzes, the app also features:</Text>

<ul class="pl-4 list-disc">
  <Text selector="li"
    ><b>Role-based authorization</b> - the app supports different roles that give
    their users various permissions. Certain actions performed by certain roles are
    also logged, which reduces the risk of abuse with power</Text
  >
  <Text selector="li"
    ><b>Good UX when creating quizzes</b> - the UI packs various quality-of-life
    features to make creating (and editing) quizzes easier. For example, when adding
    a new answer to a question, its text field will receive automatic focus, allowing
    them to start typing immediately</Text
  >
  <Text selector="li">
    <b>Feedback during a game</b> - players can easily tell if they have answered
    a question correctly or incorrectly. The app also provides a "performance" tracker,
    which shows the player how many questions they've got right or wrong, as well
    as if there are questions that are still awaiting an answer
  </Text>
  <Text selector="li"
    ><b>Administration area</b> - in line with the role-based authorization mentioned
    earlier, users that are administrators can manage certain parts of the app, such
    as promoting users to and demoting users from certain roles</Text
  >
</ul>

  >The app was originally written in Angular 16 and ASP.NET 6. It has since been
  migrated to Angular 19/20 and ASP.NET 8. On the front-end, the migration
  included a total overhaul of the UI and the addition of new quality-of-life
  features. The front-end also saw improvements in the code quality and the
  adoption of modern Angular features like signals. On the back-end, the
  migration included a significant improvement to the code and its architecture,
  as well as making the web API easier to consume (for example, in its initial
  version, there were three endpoints for retrieving a list of quizzes - one for
  all quizzes, one for searching by title, and one for retrieving a user's
  quizzes. In the new version, all of those functionalities were merged in one
  endpoint). The backend also utilizes a Redis cache store to maintain a list of
  "blacklisted" JWTs, which enables the logout functionality of the app.</Text
