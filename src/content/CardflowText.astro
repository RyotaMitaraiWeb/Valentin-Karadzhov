  ><em>Cardflow</em> is an open-source online platform that allows users to buy,
  sell, and trade TCG items like Yu-Gi-Oh cards. This was a collaborative project
  in which I participated as the main front-end engineer.</Text
>

<Text>The web app supports various functionalities, including:</Text>
<ul class="list-disc pl-4">
  <Text selector="li">Authentication and authorization</Text>
  <Text selector="li"
    >Searching, viewing, creating, editing, and deleting card offers</Text
  >
  <Text selector="li"
    >Adding items to a shopping cart and then checking them out</Text
  >
  <Text selector="li"
    >Searching users and engaging in trades with them. The trading functionality
    includes an offer tracker and a chat</Text
  >
  <Text selector="li">Tracking and managing purchases and sales</Text>
  <Text selector="li"
    >Internalization (the app is translated in Bulgarian and English)</Text
  >
  <Text selector="li">
    Profile customization, which includes support for switching default currency
    (between BGN and euro) and changing your profile picture, default shipment
    address, username, and others
  </Text>
</ul>

  >I implemented almost all of those features on the front-end single-handedly.
  The design of the UI was provided to me in Figma, though I occassionally (with
  approval) made some minor improvements to the UI when I saw that something
  could be visualized in a better way. I also wrote numerous unit and component
  tests, which helped me with my goal of making the code more maintainable.</Text

<Text
  >My involvement in the project wasn't limited to just making pages
  interactive. In particular, I have opened issues on GitHub when I discovered
  bugs with our backend API, providing detailed steps to reproduce the bugs and
  even occassionally finding out what's causing the bug, or when I needed a
  specific feature to implement something on the client. Sometimes, I even
  contributed bugfixes myself (despite having little experience with Django or
  Python in general) and very minor feature implementations. I also had the
  opportunity to review pull requests from external contributors who had
  expressed interest in contributing to the project.</Text

<Text
  >This project gave me an opportunity to work in a team with other people that
  I did not even know before that moment. In addition to communicating with each
  other on a consistent basis, I also had opportunities to raise disagreements
  when I felt that a particular decision (especially a technical one) were not
  the best and there were better options to consider.
